## Information

This repository contains a collection of cheats for the popular online game Blooket. These cheats can give you an advantage in various game modes. Please note that using cheats in online games may violate the game's terms of service and can result in penalties or bans. Use these cheats responsibly.

### How to Use

There are three recommended methods for using these scripts:

1. Importing one of the Bookmarklets.html files using [these instructions](https://github.com/TypicalShavonne/Blooket-Cheats/blob/main/tutorial/readme.md).
2. Visiting the [GitHub pages site](https://TypicalShavonne.github.io/Blooket-Cheats), choosing a game mode, and then either dragging a cheat to your bookmarks bar or clicking one to copy the script.
3. Copying a script and running it in the inspect element console.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with a cheat script not working, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure you're running it properly (see [How to Use](#how-to-use)).
2. If it still doesn't work and other cheats do, then [create an issue](https://github.com/TypicalShavonne/Blooket-Cheats/issues) to report the problem.

### FAQ

Here are some frequently asked questions about these cheats:

- **What can I do if JavaScript is blocked?**
  We don't actually know what to do about this or how to fix it, sorry.

- **(script) is not working?**
  Make sure you're running it properly (see [How to Use](#how-to-use)). If it still doesn't work and other cheats do, then [create an issue](https://github.com/TypicalShavonne/Blooket-Cheats/issues).

- **Which script should I use to make a bookmarklet?**
  You should use the scripts ending in ".min.js," as using the others will have errors due to formatting.

- **Can you give me infinite tokens / bypass daily limit / permanently give me blooks / change pack luck?**
  No, these are things we would've already done if they were possible; they're managed on the backend of Blooket, so we can't modify them.

- **Can you make hacks for (game)?**
  No.

- **Can you make more Battle Royale cheats?**
  Battle Royale is a game mode that works almost entirely on the host's end. The only thing we have control over is answering questions.

- **What happened to Minesraft2?**
  Minesraft2 was sent a cease and desist from Blooket, and I offered to take over since he wouldn't be able to.

- **How do I do this on mobile?**
  These scripts aren't made for mobile, so we don't really know how to get them to work on it.

- **What's the Mobile GUI?**
  The mobile GUI is the first GUI Minesraft2 ever made. Some people said it worked on mobile, and it's a lot neater for mobile use apparently, so we just called it that.
